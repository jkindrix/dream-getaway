# New Site Template

A template for creating a new site in the multi-site platform.

## Getting Started

1. Duplicate this template folder and rename it to your site name
2. Update the content in index.html
3. Customize the styles in css/styles.css
4. Add any JavaScript files in a js folder if needed
5. Update the router config in common/js/site-router.js to include your site
6. Add a card for your site on the main landing page

## Structure

Keep your site organized with these folders:

- `css/` - Stylesheets
- `js/` - JavaScript files
- `images/` - Image assets
- `pages/` - Additional HTML pages if needed

## Best Practices

- Use relative paths for links and assets
- Keep your site self-contained in its folder
- Share common resources via the /common directory
- Test locally before committing changes
